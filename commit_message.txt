fix(mips): Correct runtime, control flow, and code generation

This commit addresses several critical bugs in the MIPS code generator, improving correctness, efficiency, and adherence to standard execution flow.

Key fixes include:

- Runtime `print` function:
  - Resolves a 'Symbol not found' error by implementing a `print` runtime function for printing integers.
  - Adds a `.data` section for required strings (e.g., newlines).

- Function Epilogue Generation:
  - Fixes a 'Symbol not found' error for epilogue labels (e.g., `.epilogue_user_main`).
  - The epilogue is now correctly generated for all functions, regardless of whether they contain explicit `return` statements.

- Program Entry Point:
  - The MIPS `main` entry point now correctly calls the compiled user code found in `user_main` via `jal user_main`.

- Code Generation Efficiency and Correctness:
  - Improves code generation for `while` loops and assignments by reducing redundant `move` instructions.
  - Fixes a critical bug where literal assignments (e.g., `i = 0`) were handled incorrectly, leading to invalid initialization code. The generator now correctly uses `li` for literals.
  - Optimizes `if_false` branches to use registers more directly.

- Build Process:
  - Cleans up the build process by removing duplicate MIPS headers from the final assembly file.
